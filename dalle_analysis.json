  "image_description": "The image is a meme featuring a well-known photograph of a man with curly hair and facial hair. The text is formatted in bold, white capital letters, with 'HELLO' at the top and 'IS IT MEME YOU'RE LOOKING FOR?' at the bottom. It is a humorous play on a famous song lyric. At the bottom left corner, there is a website watermark 'SO MUCH PUN .COM'.",
  "composition_notes": "To recreate the image with Russian text, use a similar photo of a person with a neutral or inviting expression. Arrange the text 'ПРИВЕТ' at the top and 'ЭТОТ МЕМ ТЫ ИЩЕШЬ?' at the bottom in bold, white uppercase letters. Place the English phrase 'ТАК МНОГО КАЛАМБУРА .COM' at the bottom left corner as a watermark in a smaller font."
